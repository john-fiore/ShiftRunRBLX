# Roblox Script: Shift to Run
This is just a simple script for Roblox that allows a player to run by pressing & holding the LEFT SHIFT key.

NOTE: If you use this, import it into StarterPlayer > StarterCharacterScripts as a **LocalScript**.

This script is completely free to use - no credit is needed but is appreciated :)
